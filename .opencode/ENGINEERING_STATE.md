# Engineering State — flowstate-v5

## Current Objective
End-to-end hands-off fix-&-flip evaluation: accurate, fast, scalable, with evidence.

## Completed (this session arc)
- Vision/photo latency: merged subject renovation+curb-appeal into ONE LLM call;
  all vision resolves in one parallel batch; comp photos capped 6 (selected+nearest
  first); per-fetch timeouts (subject 20s/comp 12s). Engman 11.1s -> 7.8s.
- Renovated subjects: skipBaseRehab — vision curb-appeal "renovated" => $0 base
  $/sqft rehab; major items still charge; rehabLevel shows "Renovated".
- 7-day restore + cross-device resume of last analysis (localStorage pointer +
  GET /user/reports?limit=1 fallback).
- No-shortcuts enrichment: ALL returned comps get property-detail calls
  (subdivision + foundation + style + features) — reverted the lazy gate.
- foundation_match filter added (API evaluator + shared package), runs on all
  enriched comps; subdivision_match + foundation_match always-enabled
  (not_verified never disqualifies — safe when data missing).
- OSM location risks moved INTO enrichment batch (was post-eval fire-and-forget);
  commercial/major-road/railroad now deducts locationPenaltyPercent (default 3%
  of ARV) from buy price; surfaced in riskFlags + valuation breakdown.

## Verified
- Engman: 6.9s, ARV $344k, eval pass. After no-shortcuts enrich: all 6 comps
  carry foundation+subdivision; foundation_match passed on all; subdivision_match
  fired -> nearest_comps fallback documented (comps genuinely outside subdivision).
- Bergstrom Bay: curbAppeal renovated@100% -> rehabLevel "Renovated", rehab $0.
- Both typechecks clean.

## Pipeline Order (as specified by product)
comps search -> enrich ALL (subdivision/foundation/style) -> appraisal rules
(subdivision+foundation are hammers; not_verified-safe) -> photo+vision ONLY on
selected/rule-passing comps (+subject) -> permits subject-only -> major items ->
valuation (renovated-skip, location penalty) -> report.

## Framework Update (committed)
- Rehab framework renamed to canonical: Lipstick / Light Cosmetic / Full
  Cosmetic / Heavy Rehab / FULL GUT (was "Down to Stud") — criteria updated
  to product definitions verbatim (subject classify -> store -> price rehab).
- ARV-worthy rule tightened: comp anchors ARV ONLY if vision-verified
  renovated/retail-ready (condition==='renovated' OR rehabLevelIndex===0).
  Price inference REMOVED as eligibility — "a high sale price alone does not
  make a property an ARV comp; similarity + condition checks come first."
  Unverifiable condition => cannot influence ARV. Dated/distressed verified
  => excluded. ARV recomputed on remaining >=3; thin-set fallback documented.
- Permit status fidelity: available/empty(unavailable w/ error preserved).
- Redfin discovery via Google site:search through Firecrawl (autocomplete 403).
- StreetView no-imagery -> static insignia via metadata endpoint.

## Production-prep QA (committed)
- Deleted 6 stale python-*.test.ts regression files (dead python engine modules).
- FIXED real bug: selectCredential returned a cooling-down key when ALL
  CoreLogic creds were rate-limited -> now fails fast with "retry window"
  error (test: second call makes no request).
- FIXED: insufficientComps restored to <REQUIRED_ARV_COMPS — thin sets
  (1-2 comps) now trigger geographic -> older-sales -> nearest fallbacks.
- locationPenalty parity added to shared package (dashboard recalc carries
  the server-computed amount through — was silently dropped).
- Reports list deduped by propertyAddress (legacy dupes collapse to newest).
- ?address= param on /dashboard/analyze (extension entry; suppresses restore).
- apps/extension: MV3 right-click -> analyze extension committed.
- npm run test: 15 regression files PASS; vitest src/: all pass;
  typechecks clean both apps; next build clean (all routes).

## Pending / Next
- Observability: extend evidence with photo/vision metrics if desired.
- foundation_match visible in Evaluation Settings UI (preset editor lists filters).
- Deploy: migration 0021 needs db:migrate:remote at deploy time.

## Last Handoff
Pipeline hardened per spec. Next likely: more comp-quality evidence or
foundation_match toggle in preset UI if user wants it configurable.
